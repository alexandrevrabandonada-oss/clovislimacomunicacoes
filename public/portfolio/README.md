# Portfolio Local Files

Use numeric file names for the main sequence:

- `01.jpg`
- `02.jpg`
- `03.jpg`

You can also use nested folders (the importer is recursive), but keep names stable to preserve slugs and change tracking.

Metadata for title/type/content warning is configured in `manifest.json`.
