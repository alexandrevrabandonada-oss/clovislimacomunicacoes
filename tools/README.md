Preflight scripts

Files:
- tools/preflight.sh — POSIX shell script (macOS, Linux, WSL/Git Bash)
- tools/preflight.ps1 — PowerShell script for Windows
- tools/preflight-report.md — generated by the scripts after running

Usage:

On macOS / Linux / WSL / Git Bash:

```bash
chmod +x "tools/preflight.sh"
./tools/preflight.sh
```

On Windows (PowerShell / PowerShell Core):

```powershell
pwsh -File "tools/preflight.ps1"
# or
powershell -File "tools/preflight.ps1"
```

What the scripts do:
- Check versions: `node`, `npm`, `git` and the CLIs (`supabase`, `vercel`, `gh`)
- Try to install/update CLIs: `supabase` and `vercel` via `npm -g` (attempts `sudo` if needed), `gh` via OS package manager when possible
- Launch interactive logins when not authenticated: `supabase login`, `gh auth login`, `vercel login`
- Generate `tools/preflight-report.md` with versions, authentication status (`ok` / `nok` / `not_installed`) and the list of commands executed (the scripts never print tokens/secrets)

Notes / Caveats:
- The scripts try to be conservative; package-manager installation requires admin rights on many systems.
- If `sudo` or a package manager is not available, the script will print manual-install guidance and mark the CLI as not installed.
- The scripts avoid commands that explicitly print tokens. They do not store or echo any secrets.

If you want, I can run the appropriate script now (tell me which one).

Ship commands:

```bash
npm run ship
npm run ship:dry
```
